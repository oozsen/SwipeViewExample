SwipeView Example Week11

SwipeView is available in Xamarin.Forms 4.4. However, 
it's currently experimental and can only be used by adding the following line of code to your AppDelegate class on iOS, 
to your MainActivity class on Android, or to your App class on UWP, before calling Forms.Init:

Forms.SetFlags("SwipeView_Experimental");
